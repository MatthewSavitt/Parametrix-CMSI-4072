=======================================

SDD: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SECTION:
   Major software components section
      Nice work on this section.  Very clean!

   Major software interactions section
      Good work here, too ~ the interactions are well-defined.

   Architectural design diagrams section
      You did a professional job on the other two sections, so you should
      follow that in the design diagrams by using a 'real' drawing tool.  It
      looks like you used Squibble to do the diagrams, which I understand,
      but it doesn't look like professional-quality documentation and that
      detracts from the overall effect.

COMMENTS:
---------

Really nice work on this, Matt, but you really should fix those diagrams.

Looks like you did the detailed design part as well, or at least got a good
start on it.  You'll be ready for the next deliverable submission!

Keep up the good work!
