Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Parametrix
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   EXCELLENT work on the proposal document.  You have clearly outlined what
   the project goals are and enumerated the features and explained them very
   well.  You have provided justification for the project for its intended
   users as well as as a capstone project with clarity.

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Your presentation went well.  You obviously know your topic and what you
   expect to accomplish this semester.  You described everything well and
   answered questions well.  You talked to the audience and not the slides.

   The one suggestion I have is to include some graphics in the slides so an
   audience has some idea of what you are talking about.  For a project that
   is this graphically oriented, having some pictures in the presentation is
   never a bad idea!

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Great start to the semester, so keep up the good work.
