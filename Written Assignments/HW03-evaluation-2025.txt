Total possible score: 50 points
============================================================================

Your score: 45 out of 50 = 90% which is an A-minus

Comments/feedback:

problem 7-1, all you need to do is include a link to the wikipedia page, and
   then you can delete all the rest of the comments which become redundant.

problem 7-7, this was supposed to be a bit more than two steps.  Like, get
   in the car, put the key in the ignition, start the car, turn left, right,
   or whatever, park at the store, etc.

problem 8-9, you make a case for white box testing, but exhaustive testing
   really only needs to be black box; you are testing every possible input
   to the function and you don't really need to know how it works, just what
   the matching outputs should be.

problem 8-11, the Lincoln index works on PAIRS, so you have three different
   calculations that must be averaged:

      Testing the three different Lincoln indexes:
      Alice/Bob 5*4/2 =10
      Alice/Carmen 5*5/2 = 12.5
      Bob/Carmen 4*5/1 = 20
      To estimate the bug you could take the average of the three.
      In this case, there are 14 bugs.

Very nice work on this, Matt!
You earned 09% of 11 points which is 9.9 extra credit points.
